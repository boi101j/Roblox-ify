About this project
Roblox-ify provides a structured codebase for teams that study runtime integration patterns, binary mapping techniques, and UI design for developer tools. The project separates concerns into modules and exposes stable interfaces for experiment-driven work. The codebase targets developers who need a clean base for prototyping systems that interact with process memory, native modules, and custom UI layers. The repository emphasizes code quality, testing, and modularity.

Key features
- Modular injector abstraction that isolates platform specifics and allows safe simulation of injection workflows without executing payloads.
- DLL mapping module with clear interfaces for loading, validating, and managing native modules at runtime.
- Whitelisting system that offers configurable rules, a policy engine, and cryptographic signing of allowed assets.
- Lightweight website and UI scaffolding for a smooth developer experience.
- Test harnesses and mocks to validate behavior without performing risky operations.
- Clear developer guidelines for ethical use, responsible research, and secure deployment of experiments.

High-level architecture
The codebase follows a layered architecture:
- Core: pure logic, policy rules, utilities, and test helpers.
- Platform: OS and runtime-specific adapters and safe simulators.
- Integration: code that stitches core logic to platform adapters.
- UI: desktop UI and web UI components.
- Website: static site for documentation and downloads.
- Tests: unit and integration tests that run in CI without risky actions.

Core goals
- Make experiments reproducible.
- Provide mockable interfaces so developers can test scenarios without altering a host process.
- Keep the UI and website decoupled from the core logic.
- Make it easy to audit and review the code.

Component breakdown

Injector abstraction
Purpose
- Provide a unified interface that models the steps of an injection workflow.
- Allow safe emulation and unit testing of injection scenarios without performing any actual injection.

Design
- Expose a simple interface:
  - prepare(targetProcess)
  - stage(payload)
  - validate()
  - simulateInject() // safe, non-destructive simulation
  - commit() // only for authorized, audited environments (not provided in tests)
- Keep platform adapters under a distinct folder: platform/win32, platform/linux, platform/macos
- Provide mock adapters for CI. Mocks return deterministic results and exercise code paths.

Key types and interfaces (conceptual)
- IInjector: { prepare, stage, validate, simulateInject, commit }
- InjectorResult: { status, logs, metrics }
- InjectorConfig: { timeoutMs, validationRules, sandboxMode }

Safety model
- Default mode runs in sandbox and simulation mode.
- commit() requires explicit opt-in and cannot run in CI or when tests run.
- All adapters must implement safe-checks that detect hostile environments.

DLL mapper (design overview)
Purpose
- Model the process of loading and mapping native modules in a controlled, auditable way.
- Provide validation hooks to check signatures, layout, and expected imports.

Design principles
- Keep actual mapping code behind a feature flag.
- Expose a "mapper simulator" that walks the mapping steps and records decisions.
- Store metadata for each mapped module: filename, hash, mapping timestamp, validation results.

Interfaces
- IMapper: { analyze(file), mapToProcess(target), simulateMap() }
- MappingReport: { fileHash, sections, imports, exports, validationErrors }

Instrumentation
- Provide structured logs and JSON reports for audits.
- Ensure reports exclude secrets or sensitive data.

Whitelisting subsystem
Purpose
- Maintain an allowlist for approved assets and operations.
- Allow teams to define, sign, and distribute policy files.

Components
- Policy engine: evaluates rules against a candidate asset.
- Signer: cryptographic signing and verification utilities.
- Policy store: local and remote policy distributions.

Policy format (conceptual JSON)
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "rules": [
    {"id":"signed_assets", "type":"signature", "required":true},
    {"id":"hash_allowlist", "type":"hash", "hashes":["..."] }
  ],
  "metadata": {"author":"team@example.com", "created":"2024-01-01"}
}

Signer
- Uses common cryptographic libraries for signing.
- Use strong keys and rotate them regularly.
- Provide verification APIs that return clear, structured results.

Policy distribution
- Policies can be stored in the repository or served from a signed remote endpoint.
- The code supports updating policies in a safe manner and verifying signatures.

UI and website
Purpose
- Offer a clean, simple UI for developers to interact with the toolset.
- Provide a documentation site and a downloads page.

Desktop UI
- Built on a lightweight cross-platform toolkit.
- Key screens:
  - Dashboard: status, latest logs, metrics.
  - Policy manager: view and apply policies.
  - Mocks and simulators: run a simulated workflow and inspect steps.
  - Logs and reports: view JSON reports and export them.

Website
- Static site generator with Markdown-based docs and a downloads page.
- Releases page links to prebuilt packages and assets.
- Provide quick start guides that emphasize safe simulation and testing.

Core executor logic
Purpose
- Provide the engine for executing a controlled sequence of steps.
- Designed for testability and traceability.

Phases
- Initialization: load config, initialize policy engine.
- Preparation: validate target, prepare simulated environment.
- Staging: stage payloads into a workspace.
- Validation: run policy checks and produce a report.
- Simulation: execute a simulated run and collect traces.
- Reporting: store reports and present them via UI and website.

Observability
- Log each phase with structured logs.
- Expose metrics for performance tests.
- Offer JSON and human-readable exports.

Data flow and lifecycle
Execution model
- Inputs: config, target descriptor, payload descriptors, policy.
- Outputs: mapping reports, validation results, simulation traces.

Trace model
- Each run produces a trace that includes:
  - step name
  - timestamp
  - duration
  - result (pass/fail)
  - artifacts (report files, logs)
- Traces persist in a dedicated directory with automatic rotation.

Persistence
- Store artifacts under a configurable workspace path.
- Provide a "clean" command to prune old runs.

Build and development workflow (safe, non-actionable)
This section describes how to set up a local development environment and run tests that do not perform any risky operations. The instructions avoid runtime actions that modify other processes or load native modules into third-party processes.

Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js (for website and UI scaffolding)
- Rust or Go toolchain (optional, for core components)
- A container runtime (Docker) for isolated test runs

Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/boi101j/Roblox-ify.git
- cd Roblox-ify

Install dependencies
- Use the repository's package manager instructions in the platform-specific README files.
- Most development tasks run against mock adapters and do not require elevated permissions.

Run tests
- Use the test runner documented in the repository root.
- Tests include unit tests for the policy engine, mapper simulator, and UI components.
- CI runs on safe mode with mocks.

Simulated runs
- The repository exposes a simulator binary that walks injection/mapping steps without performing any live injection.
- Use the simulator to validate policy decisions and produce trace logs.

Note on releases and prebuilt assets
- The Releases page hosts compiled packages and assets that teams can use for testing and review.
- Review assets before use and run them inside a controlled environment if you need to inspect binary behavior.

Testing strategy
Test types
- Unit tests: pure functions, policy evaluation, signing utilities.
- Integration tests: run multiple components together in simulation mode.
- UI tests: snapshot tests for components.
- Fuzz tests: feed random policy inputs to the policy engine to validate resilience.

CI
- The repository uses CI to run tests on push and pull requests.
- CI jobs run in isolation and do not run any commit() actions or production-only code paths.

Code review and quality
- Enforce lint and style checks.
- Require pull request reviews for all changes.
- Use small, focused PRs.

Security, safety, and ethics
Security model
- The project treats code that touches process memory as high-risk.
- Risky pathways live behind explicit feature flags.
- Default builds disable sensitive features.

Ethical stance
- The codebase targets developers who perform controlled research and testing.
- The repository encourages responsible disclosure, auditability, and transparent policy management.
- Use the project inside teams or labs with appropriate permissions and oversight.

Auditability
- All key operations produce signed reports and structured logs.
- The project supports generating audit records for research workflows.

Integration points and APIs
Public APIs (conceptual)
- Policy API: validatePolicy(policy, asset) -> ValidationResult
- Signer API: sign(data, key) -> signature; verify(data, signature, key) -> bool
- Injector API (simulated): simulateInject(target, payload, config) -> SimulationReport
- Mapper API (simulated): analyze(file) -> MappingReport

SDKs
- The repository exposes a small SDK for scripting:
  - Node SDK for website and tooling.
  - Rust or Go bindings for core logic.

Example SDK usage (conceptual)
```js
const sdk = require('roblox-ify-sdk');

async function runSim() {
  const policy = await sdk.loadPolicy('./policies/default.json');
  const result = await sdk.simulator.run({
    target: { pid: 1234, name: 'example-process' },
    payload: './assets/sample.bin',
    policy
  });
  console.log(result.traceSummary);
}
```

UI and UX notes
Design goals
- Keep the UI minimal and clear.
- Show actionable data: validation results, traces, and signed artifacts.
- Use color only to convey status.

Accessibility
- Use keyboard-friendly controls.
- Ensure high-contrast themes.

Theme and assets
- Provide light and dark themes.
- Use clear icons and avoid game branding in UI assets.

Screenshots and mockups
- The repository contains mock screenshots for the dashboard, policy manager, and simulator.
- These images help reviewers and auditors understand workflows without running sensitive code.

Troubleshooting and common questions
Q: I want to inspect how the mapper works under the hood.
A: Use the mapper simulator module. It walks the steps and produces a detailed JSON report that includes section analysis, import/export tables, and hash summaries.

Q: Can I run a full mapping on a live process?
A: The mainline codebase focuses on simulation and testing. Any live actions live behind feature flags and require explicit review and permission. Review the platform adapter docs before enabling such features.

Q: Where do I find prebuilt assets or packages?
A: See the Releases page for packaged builds and artifacts:
https://github.com/boi101j/Roblox-ify/releases

Q: How do I add a new policy rule?
A: Add a JSON rule to the rules directory and write a unit test that validates expected behavior. The policy engine uses clear APIs to evaluate new rule types. Follow existing rule tests as examples.
